## Format

To keep things consistent please use a similar format to contribute to this page. Which is as follows:

```
- https://link_to_website.com - context about website
```

1. `-` is used to create a list in markdown
2. then the plain link
3. `-` with spaces around it to separate between the link and context
4. context as to why the link is getting submitted.

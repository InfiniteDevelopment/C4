# Ways to contributes

:tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute or consider contributing! :tada:

If your new to contributing on github in general, checkout this guide that they made to help understand the workflow: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

There are so may different types of C2 frameworks out there, and I will try and find all the different types of C2 frameworks that I can. 
Unfortunetelly I won't be able to find everything...even since I started this I added a new framework based on someone's recommendation from [twitter](https://twitter.com/MrBenChung/status/1174437717842640897).
So, I will definitely rely on the community to help add to this to make it comprehensive.

Currently the only ways I can think of having people contribute is [issues](#issues), [pull requests](#pull-requests), [external content](#external-content).
If you can think of a any other way, please feel free to submit a `Request a change` issue or message me on the Professionally Evil slack (link on main [README](/README.md#C4)) so we can dicuss how to implement it.

## Format

Please always have a corresponding issue to a pull request or a link to a slack converation we had in the [Professionally Evil Slack](https://professionallyevil.slack.com/messages/c4), so there can be a coversation about what needs to be done before a direct submission (if there is a small enough patch (i.e. fixing text formatting or spellchecking) then you can submit a pull request ).
If I do close a pull request with a `please make issue` label then please don't take offense to it, I simply want to keep better track of what is happening and am just inferior to your more intellectual knowledge of being able to do it without one :smile:.

Along with having a corresponding issue, please in the appropriate pull request have the comment or title be something like closes (or corresponds to) #xyz (replace xyz with your issue number).
Then when the pull request gets merged it will close that corresponding issue (you can read more [here)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords).
If you don't want to close it then just make sure you link back to corresponding issue by including `#xyz` (replace xyz with your issue number) in your issue.

### Meta

[Projects](https://github.com/ProfessionallyEvil/C4/projects) and [milestones](https://github.com/ProfessionallyEvil/C4/milestones) are going to be used heavily to keep track of progress of when something should be considered "complete" (i.e. as complete as possible at the moment).

## Templates

There will be a few github templates people can use to help with keeping this project informed as to what needs to be reviewed and added.

### Issues

To list a few examples of that we will have github issue templates for the following:

- [New Framework Submission (NFS)](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/nfs.md)
- [New video submission](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/video-sub.md) - could mean there is no current video or you would like to submit more links for the mentioned c2 framework
  - Please look [here](#video-submissions) before trying to submit a video review for a C2 framework
- [New comparison point](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-comparison.md) - should be a comparison point that is used, and how each current framework rates with it
- [Request a change](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/request-change.md) (altered initial bug template) - information might not be 100% accurate please consider fixing
- [New template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-template.md) - request a new issue or pull request template
- [Feature Request](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-req.md) - request something new for the repo to do

### Pull Requests

_if your request gets closed before merge please checkout the [format section](#format)_

To list a few examples of that we will have github pull request templates for the following:

- video submission - when submitting a video to the project
- comparison points - when something needs to be added to the comparison chart that compares all the C2 frameworks
- meta - all the project specific meta information (i.e. create a label, milestone, folder to organize, for it). most of these items (i.e. creation of labels, milestones, templates, etc...) will have to be done by a project owner, but if you want to submit a pull request 
- request a change - when something is not accurate and you would like to fix it


## External Content

There will be some instances (i.e. creating videos) that there will be external content that needs to be generated.
If you would like to contribute to these types of issues, then just please comment saying you want to do it, before acting on it, on the corrisponding github issue.
This will help keep communication clear as to where work is getting distributed and allows individuals not to overlap and do uncessary work.
Then I can also assign the task to you as well, so it is clear who is currently working on the issue.

### Video submissions

If you want to submit video review please ensure that you cover most, if not all, the comparison points.
A good point of reference for security tool reviews are the following youtube channels (if you know of more please submit a bug issue):

- [The Cyber Mentor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0ArlFuFYMpEewyRBzdLHiw)
- [webpwnized](https://www.youtube.com/user/webpwnized)
